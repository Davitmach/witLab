  <p className="my-[10px] text-[16px] leading-[105%]"><strong>Usage analytics:</strong> collected through third-party tools and SDKs (such as those provided by Apple, Google, or analytics providers), to improve app performance and support marketing efforts.</p>
  <p className="my-[10px] text-[16px] leading-[105%]"><strong>Payment data:</strong> payments within the app are processed through external platforms (such as Apple App Store or Google Play). We do not store or access your sensitive payment details. If payments are made directly on our website, they are handled by PCI DSS-certified providers using secure, tokenized methods.</p>
  <p className="my-[10px] text-[16px] leading-[105%]"><strong>Third-party logins:</strong> if you log in using platforms like Facebook or Apple, we may receive information needed to verify your account, but these platforms may process your data according to their own policies.</p>
  <p className="my-[10px] text-[16px] leading-[105%]"><strong>External content and social media:</strong> the app may include links or features integrating with other services. Data shared on those platforms is subject to their policies. Public posts referencing our app (e.g., hashtags) may be used for our services, but management of that data is determined by those platforms.</p>
  <h2 className="my-[20px] text-[20px] leading-[105%] font-bold sm:text-[26px] md:text-[36px]">How and Why We Use Your Data</h2>
